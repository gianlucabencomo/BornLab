I have made some decent progress cleaning up and building out my analysis pipeline.  By the end, I hope to have a pipeline that integrates well into rlange's pipeline.

Some considerations:
1) I must be using rlange's suite of task loading functions that way anyone with his configurations can use my code.  It will make it easier for rlange to use my code.
2) Everything starts in Matlab so it should also end in Matlab.  Some of the visualizations can be done in python but I imagine that rlange would like all of the outputs of the model to be able to be analyzed in Matlab.

This Thursday, when we have our group meeting, I should table a conversation about the load task data functions and the best way to use them for my analysis and I should also ask rlange what he wants on the output side.  I will write a little bit of code every day, in between my work for Griffiths and ml readings.
